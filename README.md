International Students are a massive cog in the greater system that accounts for college students in the United States. They come from a diverse panel of countries, and pursue an even wider variety of disciplines. According to UW, they account for 14.2% of UW's student body, almost 10% higher than the national average. Yet, there seems to be a gap between local and international students when it comes to social interaction and a general understanding of each other's similarities & differences. By providing various figures and visualizations describing the international student experience, we aim to bridge this gap.

In exploring this topic, we came up with several key questions that we were looking to solve regarding international students and their academic patterns.

Question 1

1.) How has the international student demographic changed over time? How has the distribution of majors and scores changed over this span?

Question 2:

2.) How do the majors of international students vary across different countries of origin?

Question 3:

3.) Where do international students get their tuition from?

Question 4

4.) Which cities do international students tend to attend for school?

By answering these questions, we open a window to see aspects of the international student experience. This is valuable for a number of reasons.
